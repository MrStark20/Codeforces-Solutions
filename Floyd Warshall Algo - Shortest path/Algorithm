In Floyd Warshall Algo, we calculate the minimum weighted path between two vertices -- --- > Using DP.

First we Initialize our DP by the edges given with their weight,

Then we change and bring one INTERMEDIATORY vertex in every path and check the weight from them, if we get smaller weight then we update our DP, 
otherwise it remains same,

code => 

dp[N][N];

rep(i,n){
  rep(j,n){
      if(path exists)
        dp[i][j]= value;
      else
        dp[i][j] =Infinity;  
  }
}

  rep(k,n){
    rep(i,n){
      rep(j,n){
          dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] );
      }
    }
  }
